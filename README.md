Hi,

This is a project I developed using MEANJS. It is a business website, for selling products. 

Client functions:
view products, add to cart, place order, view/track order, manage addresses, edit profile

Admin functions:
manage products, manage orders, manage users

I didn't do much about users part due to the powerful functions MEANJS offered. 

I am currently working on deployment. Once it done, I'll put sample website links here.

For security reasons, I didn't add payment function in this project.
