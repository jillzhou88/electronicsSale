Hi,

This is a project I developed using MEANJS. It is a business website, for selling products. 

Client functions:
search, view products, add to cart, place order, view/track order, manage addresses, edit profile

Admin functions:
manage products, manage orders, manage users

I didn't do much about users part due to the powerful functions MEANJS offered. 

website sample:
http://ec2-54-67-98-58.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:3000

Problems:
there is a problem with the search function. When I tried it on local environment, it worked perfectly; but on the aws server, it shows error 422 with message "something went wrong". I am still working on it, but no clue what went wrong.

For security reasons, I didn't add payment function in this project.
